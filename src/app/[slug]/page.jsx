            <p>These are the top seven trends we will notice in 2024.</p>
<h3 id="h-1-serp-and-visual-optimization" class="wp-block-heading">1. SERP and visual optimization</h3>
<p>In Google SGE and the SERPs, rich results will continue to evolve. Ongoing SERP optimization will be critical as we expect zero-click results to grow due to SGE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to get into the AI-generated answer (or snapshot)? Keep publishing fast-loading pages filled with relevant, helpful, valuable and unique content. Some specific areas to prioritize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiential/informational videos.</li>
<li>Web stories.</li>
<li>Podcasts.</li>
<li>Webinars.</li>
<li><a href="https://searchengineland.com/visual-optimization-must-haves-ai-powered-search-433908">Visual optimization</a>.</li>
<li>FAQ/PAA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h-2-helpful-content-and-content-intelligence" class="wp-block-heading">2. Helpful content and content intelligence</h3>
<p>A rock-solid&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/safeguard-content-strategy-ai-driven-search-landscape-431023">content strategy</a>&nbsp;will be essential in 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find and fill relevant content gaps.</li>
<li>Review content performance.</li>
<li>Create personalized content based on user intent and touchpoints.</li>
<li>Create and optimize various types of helpful content (e.g., topical and informational, localized, visual).</li>
</ul>
<p>You want to demonstrate high levels of E-E-A-T and publish content written or reviewed by subject matter experts or demonstrate hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Every search happens because someone wants or needs something. Your content should help searchers achieve goals or complete tasks. How a user interacts with your content is just as important as the content itself.</p>
<p>To meaningfully do this, your strategy should include creating buyer personas. Create content based on the buyer&rsquo;s journey at every touch point. Survey your customers and ensure content and UX align with the strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Content intelligence</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; knowing what type of content will perform, based on data &ndash; should become your foundation of content creation.</p>
<p>Several generative AI tools and plugins can quickly create content, sure, but it&rsquo;s typically unclear:</p>
<ul>
<li>What content types will perform well.</li>
<li>How to humanize content.</li>
<li>How to forecast the effectiveness of a content strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Establishing a data-driven approach to measure the effectiveness of content will become crucial for content creators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-3-engagement-and-experience" class="wp-block-heading">3. Engagement and experience</h3>
<p><a href="https://searchengineland.com/how-google-search-ranking-works-pandu-nayak-435395">User interactions and engagement</a>&nbsp;are important factors that shape Google&rsquo;s search results.</p>
<p>Google wants to reward expert-level content that is compelling and meets the needs of searchers.</p>
<p>Your goal in 2024 should be to improve the quality and experience for searchers by improving the quality of your content and experience of your digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-4-personalized-experience" class="wp-block-heading">4. Personalized experience</h3>
<p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai said&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-ceo-search-will-evolve-substantively-in-next-10-years-395437">search will evolve substantively in the next 10 years</a>.&nbsp;Search will be more personalized to impact users more profoundly and meaningfully.</p>
<p>That may be why, on Nov. 15, Google introduced a&nbsp;<a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-launches-new-personal-search-experience-with-follow-button-and-personalized-ranking-434627">personalized search experience</a>, including a new Follow button, to show searchers more information about what they care about directly in their search results.</p>
<p>You also should give your customers personalized experiences based on who they are, what they are looking for and where they are coming from.</p>
<p>This means a tighter integration with your CDP (customer data platform) and CRM (customer relationship management) systems to ensure a personalized experience.</p>
<p>Clean data, audience segmentatio, and data-driven campaigns to personalize experience are critical strategies to win in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-5-multichannel-approach" class="wp-block-heading">5. Multichannel approach</h3>
<p>Take advantage of all opportunities on what will become increasingly competitive SERP real estate with limited inventory for organic listings. That means optimizing the customer journey across various channels and content types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos.</li>
<li>Images.</li>
<li>FAQs.</li>
<li>PAAs.</li>
<li>News.</li>
<li>Webinars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be everywhere. Be consistent.</p>
<h3 id="h-6-local-strategy-needs-to-be-more-personalized-localized-and-experiential-nbsp" class="wp-block-heading">6. Local Strategy needs to be more personalized, localized, and experiential.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If your brand has a local presence, add localized experiences to build expertise, engagement and traffic. For destination-based content, think:</p>

            </div>
            <Comments/>
            </div>

            <div className='sideMenu'>
